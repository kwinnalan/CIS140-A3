Part A

This is a tutorial I made for the Linux vim text editor. 

I explain and give examples for the following:

1. Starting, not saving, saving, and exiting vi.

2. The different modes

3. Vi searching

4. Moving the cursor

5. Inserting & deleting text

6. Cut, copy, paste

7. Insert command output in a vi text file

8. .exrc file and some useful commands to put in it. 

Part B
Is a file that finds all tmp files in the sandbox directories and deletes them. Then the file will find all files that have the .html extension, search them for the string “oncology” and redirect the output to a file called oncology-pages. Next, it will find all the files with the .html extension, search them for the string ‘radiology’ and redirect the output to a file called radiology-pages. It then uses one of the file comparison commands and the input redirector to create an output file that shows the differences between the two files.

Part B 2
Is a file that finds all tmp files in the sandbox directories and deletes them. Then the file will find all files that have the .html extension, search inside them for the string “oncology” and redirect the output to a file called oncology-pages. Next, find all the files with the .html extension, search inside them for the string ‘radiology’ and redirect the output to a file called radiology-pages. It then uses one of the file comparison commands and the input redirector to create an output file that shows the differences between the two files.
